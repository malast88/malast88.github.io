# Just finished Implementing a Full CI/CD Pipeline course from Linux Academy
Very comprehensive course which gives a good understanding of a full delivery pipeline.
It starts from the basic concepts like using VCS (git) and build automation (gradle), then engages continuous integration using Jenkins, 
continues with continuous delivery and deployment, and finally explains orchestration via kubernetes and canary deployment. 
Hands-on labs also good, quite boring to recreate access credentials each time, but it is understandable limitation. I really like this course.
