# Just finished AWS Essentials course from Linux Academy
Course consists of a good explanation of AWS basics, shown from the perspective of building small project from scratch. 
It also contains some practice exercises, provided on the real temporary AWS environment.
That's why it is actually quite longer than 8 hours.

I would say this basic course from Linux Academy is much better than one from [the official AWS training provider](https://www.aws.training).
It is well structured and assembled with some practical details which are necessary to understand the topic.
At the same time, it appears balanced and not overloaded by technical stuff, every thing is on its place.
