# Just finished Source Control with Git course from Linux Academy
Well, not so much to say - the majority of the material I knew and actively used before passing the course. 
The only exception - GitLab chapter.
At least now I have some proof that I actually know something about Git.

{% assign cert = site.data.certs | where: "id","la-git" | first %}

[Certificate URl]({{ cert.url }})

![Certificate screenshot]({{ cert.filePNG }})
